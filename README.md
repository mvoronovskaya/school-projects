# Two Player Airplain Game in 2D

  One player will control their plain with the arrow keys and fire bullets with the Enter/Return key. 
  The other player will control their plain with A,S,D, and W keys and will fire bullets with the space bar. Enemy planes will appear from the front. Both of the player's plains can only take a limited ammount of damage before they are destroyed. The mission will be aborted if either of your planes is destroyed.
  The game consists of only one level. 
  It will present you with increasingly difficult waves of planes and end with a battle against the infamous general himself.
